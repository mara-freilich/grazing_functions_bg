# Code and data used in the submitted manuscript "Grazing dynamics reconcile critical depth and disturbance-recoveryhypotheses for North Atlantic bloom"
Code and data in this repository can be used to produce all manuscript figures. The codes run a model of phytoplankton-zooplankton dynamics with different grazing functions. Plotting includes time series and phase portraits.
